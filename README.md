# Skin cancer is one of the most serious types of cancer, but the chances of successful
treatment improve greatly if it is detected early. However, traditional methods for
diagnosing skin cancer often depend on visual checks by dermatologists, which can
sometimes be inaccurate. In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in
helping with the early and accurate detection of skin cancer. This paper focuses on
developing a skin cancer detection model that uses advanced deep learning techniques, includingEfficientNet, VGG19, Inception, Xception , ResNet and CNN. These models
are pre-trained on a large dataset from the ISIC skin cancer database, which helps the
system learn to classify skin lesions as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non- cancerous). The model follows several key steps, such as image processing, feature
extraction, and classification, with a special emphasis on improving segmentation and
classification. The goal is to create a reliable tool that can help doctors diagnose skin
cancer more accurately by analyzing images of skin lesions, potentially saving lives
through early detection.
