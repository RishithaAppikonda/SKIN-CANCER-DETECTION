The ISIC skin cancer detection dataset provides a well-curated collection of 2,637
skin lesion images, which are invaluable for training models to distinguish between
benign and malignant cases. Out of these, 1,440 images represent benign lesions, while the remaining 1,197 depict malignant cases, reflecting a balanced approach
toward both categories.
